I decided to make the code as simple and readable as possible, you can find it in the main.cpp, 
I also attached a file for tests(TEST.txt), just add it to the directory where the main.cpp is and run. 
In EmailQuestions_VWAPer.cpp file (I did not change its name) I wrote my comments to the code at the end of file.
